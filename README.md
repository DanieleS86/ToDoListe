# ToDoListe
Integration of a to-do list, into a German ERP system developed in c# WindowsForms.


This to-do list is based on the creation of a new product and the various steps that the workers involved must perform in parallel to achieve the final goal together: the production launch of the product.

The primary purpose of using the to-do list in the system is to support this process. However, an additional section has been implemented where special tasks can be assigned to different workersâ€”tasks such as making modifications to products or even creating something unrelated to any product.
